HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS:

In general the website works like a search engine, but this one works for a close group of data saved into 
our SQL database.

> User can access it and search by keyworkd, at the seach, result will come with 
  medecine name, madecine description and owning pharmacy name, address number so 
  that the user(sick person in this case or the one helping) can have the nearest 
  pharmacy with required medecine.

> There is admin side of the Pharmacie owner, once registered, and logged in the owner can add stock of 
  medecines they have in real time, if the medecine is no
  longer available in their pharmacy they can delete it where it no longer availbale for the end-user..
